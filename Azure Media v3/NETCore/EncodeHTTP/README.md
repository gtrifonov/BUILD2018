The following bash shell script creates a service principal for the account and returns the app.config settings as xml

    #!/bin/bash

    resourceGroup=build2018
    amsAccountName=build2018
    amsSPName=build2018AADapplication

    # Create a service principal with password and configure its access to an Azure Media Services account.
    az ams account sp create \
    --account-name $amsAccountName \
    --name $amsSPName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --role Owner \
